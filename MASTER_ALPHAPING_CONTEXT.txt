FILE: codex/VOICE_TONE_LANGUAGE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Voice, Tone & Language Codex

## Purpose
This document defines how AlphaPing communicates externally.
It is binding for all written communication: website, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Substack, reports, and announcements.

If content could be published under a competitor’s name and still sound correct, it FAILS.

---

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.

- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## AlphaPing Voice (What we sound like)

- Institutional
- Calm
- Precise
- Constraint-driven
- Experience-based
- Non-promotional
- Operator-first, not marketing-first

We speak like an operator reporting facts to a senior investment committee.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.

- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Language Rules (Non-Negotiable)

ALWAYS:
- Use plain, concrete language

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Category Discipline Rule

AlphaPing is NOT:
- A protocol
- An infrastructure provider
- A yield aggregator
- A marketing platform

AlphaPing IS:
- An operator layer

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:

- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Swap Test (Hard Fail Rule)

If replacing “AlphaPing” with:
- Any other DeFi operator
- Any risk manager
- Any vault curator

…does NOT materially break the meaning, the content FAILS and must be rewritten.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Default Writing Bias

- Factual > aspirational
- Operational > narrative
- Specific > generic
- Constraint > upside

==================================================
FILE: codex/NARRATIVE_POSITIONING.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Narrative & Positioning Codex

## Core Positioning

AlphaPing operates the vault layer for institutional funds.

We do not provide infrastructure.
We do not sell software.
We do not compete with funds.

We deploy, operate, and distribute vaults on behalf of funds that do not want to build an operator organization themselves.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## The Problem We Solve

Launching a vault is not the hard part.
Operating a vault over time is.

Real vault operations require:
- Continuous risk management
- Collateral selection and maintenance
- Liquidation readiness and counterparties
- Protocol relationships
- Market monitoring through stress
- Distribution and allocator access

Most funds underestimate this operational surface area.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## AlphaPing’s Role

AlphaPing acts as the **operator of record**.

For partner funds, this means:
- AlphaPing deploys and manages the vault
- AlphaPing defines and enforces the mandate
- AlphaPing handles collateral frameworks and relationships
- AlphaPing manages liquidation paths and execution readiness
- AlphaPing connects the vault to allocator and aggregator distribution

The partner fund does not need to build these capabilities internally.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Distribution Advantage

Vaults operated by AlphaPing are not isolated.

AlphaPing brings:
- Existing allocator relationships
- Visibility across yield aggregation platforms
- External capital beyond the partner’s own LP base

This creates a secondary income stream for the partner fund via management fees on externally sourced capital.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Economic Structure (Canonical)

- AlphaPing earns a performance fee on realized yield
- The partner fund may earn a management fee (e.g. 0.5% p.a.)
- Fees are transparent and defined upfront
- Incentives are aligned: performance for AlphaPing, scale for the partner

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## What Makes This Defensible

AlphaPing’s edge compounds over time:
- Operational track record
- Stress-tested vault history
- Collateral and protocol relationships
- Allocator trust
- Distribution access

This cannot be replicated quickly by new entrants.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.
- Do NOT propose publishing, replies, or next steps.
- Do NOT add summaries or conclusions.
- Do NOT add CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

Assume:
- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft:
STOP.


## Category Definition

AlphaPing defines a distinct category:

**Operator-Grade Vault Management with Embedded Distribution**

This is not infrastructure.
This is not advisory.
This is execution.

If any answer is NO, the content fails.

==================================================
FILE: codex/ANATOMY_GATE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Content Anatomy Gate (Mandatory)

This document is a hard gate for all AlphaPing external content.

## Exact ChatGPT Initialization Prompt (Paste Verbatim)

This prompt MUST be pasted at the top of every new ChatGPT conversation:

You are drafting AlphaPing content.

You must strictly follow the AlphaPing codex files provided below.
You may not invent structure, tone, facts, or positioning.

You must follow the AlphaPing Content Anatomy Gate.
You may only use ONE skeleton and must not add sections.

If anything is unclear or missing, STOP and ask instead of guessing.

First, confirm which skeleton will be used and list its required sections.
Then produce a draft that fills ONLY those sections.

The draft MUST begin with:
Skeleton Used: 

If ChatGPT does not restate the skeleton and sections first, STOP.

---

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do NOT provide explanations, commentary, alternatives, or suggestions.

3. Copy contents
4. Open a NEW ChatGPT chat
5. Paste:
   - Initialization prompt
   - Codex files
   - Chosen skeleton
   - Weekly theme
6. Ask ChatGPT to draft
7. Verify:
   - Skeleton declaration present
   - No extra sections
8. Save draft to `/drafts`

Skipping any step = rejection.

OUTPUT & STOP RULE

- Produce exactly ONE draft.

STOP.


## What ChatGPT Is NOT Allowed To Do

ChatGPT must NOT:
- Invent facts
- Invent AlphaPing positioning
- Optimize for engagement
- Add conclusions or CTAs
- Add sections beyond the skeleton
- Summarize the codex instead of following it

“ChatGPT suggested it” is not a valid justification.

# AlphaPing — Voice Rules (Binding)

## Purpose
These rules govern every external draft. If any rule conflicts with a task request, STOP and ask. Do not guess.

## Voice: non-negotiables
- Constraint-driven, operator-grade, institutional
- Calm, precise, concrete
- Facts over vibes
- No hype, no marketing energy
- Write like an IC memo distilled into public language

## Tone controls
- Prefer short sentences.
- Prefer nouns/verbs over adjectives.
- State the constraint first; yield is a consequence.
- Avoid “thought leader cadence” and rhetorical flourishes.
- Never sound like a creator, influencer, or newsletter.

## Evidence discipline
- Do not invent numbers, outcomes, rankings, or timelines.
- If data is missing, STOP and request the missing input.
- Do not imply guarantees or certainty about markets.

## Output discipline
- Produce exactly ONE draft.
- Do not provide variants.
- Do not ask “do you want it sharper” or similar.
- After drafting: STOP.

FILE: codex/SWAP_TEST_CRITERIA.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Swap Test Criteria (Binding)

## Purpose
This is the preflight test for any draft. If the draft passes the swap test, it is too generic and must be rewritten.

## Swap test (must FAIL)
If the text still reads naturally when replacing "AlphaPing" with a competitor or generic operator, it FAILS.

### Examples of swaps to test
- Replace "AlphaPing" with: "a DeFi vault manager", "a credit fund", "a protocol", "a competitor"
- Replace "operator-grade" with: "best-in-class", "institutional-grade", "robust"

## Pass condition
The text contains at least one AlphaPing-specific constraint, mechanism, or governance posture that would be false or awkward for a generic competitor.

## If you cannot make it pass
STOP and ask for the missing AlphaPing-specific inputs (e.g., mandate constraint, liquidity rule, benchmark rule, withdrawal behavior, risk bound, operational invariant).

FILE: codex/STRUCTURAL_CONSTRAINTS.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Structural Constraints (Binding)

## Purpose
These rules prevent scope creep and “helpful” ChatGPT behavior.

## Mandatory structure constraints
- Use ONLY the declared skeleton.
- Do NOT add sections.
- Do NOT reorder sections.
- Do NOT add conclusions, summaries, or CTAs unless explicitly required by the skeleton.

## Content constraints
- No invented facts.
- No “industry commentary” unless requested and supported by provided material.
- No engagement bait: questions to the reader, hot takes, outrage, dunking.

## Interaction constraints
- Do not offer multiple versions.
- Do not ask what tone the user wants after drafting.
- If skeleton is missing: STOP and request it.
- If required inputs are missing: STOP and request them.

## Output constraint
- Produce ONE draft only, then STOP.

==================================================
FILE: codex/DISALLOWED_LANGUAGE_LIST.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Disallowed Language List (Binding)

## Purpose
These phrases and patterns are banned because they trigger hype, vagueness, or generic marketing tone.

## Banned hype / sales language
- "game-changer", "revolutionary", "next-gen", "cutting-edge"
- "best-in-class", "industry-leading", "world-class"
- "unlock", "supercharge", "moon", "alpha leaks"

## Banned engagement bait
- "Here’s the thing", "Let’s talk about", "You won’t believe"
- "Thread 🧵", "Read this", "hot take"
- "Say the word", "Want a version", "I can also"

## Banned vague claims
- "safe", "guaranteed", "risk-free", "always", "never fails"
- "proven", "bulletproof" (unless strictly evidenced and defined)

## Banned fluff / filler
- "clean operator-grade", "fits your tone" (meta-commentary)
- "slightly more", "tighter", "sharper" (variant framing)

## Rule
If a draft relies on any banned pattern, rewrite. If rewriting requires missing inputs, STOP and ask.
