AlphaPing — MASTER CONTEXT (AUTO-GENERATED)
Last generated (UTC): 2026-02-02 10:01:45


==================================================
FILE: codex/VOICE_TONE_LANGUAGE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Voice, Tone & Language Codex

## Purpose
This document defines how AlphaPing communicates externally.
It is binding for all written communication: website, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Substack, reports, and announcements.

If content could be published under a competitor’s name and still sound correct, it FAILS.

---

## AlphaPing Voice (What we sound like)

- Institutional
- Calm
- Precise
- Constraint-driven
- Experience-based
- Non-promotional
- Operator-first, not marketing-first

We speak like an operator reporting facts to a senior investment committee.

---

## AlphaPing Tone (How it feels)

- No hype
- No urgency
- No persuasion language
- No exaggeration
- No emotional reassurance

Confidence comes from control and continuity, not claims.

---

## Language Rules (Non-Negotiable)

ALWAYS:
- Use plain, concrete language
- Anchor statements in structure, process, or outcomes
- Prefer short, declarative sentences
- Describe *what is*, not *what could be*

NEVER:
- Use buzzwords
- Use superlatives (best, leading, premier, world-class)
- Use marketing adjectives
- Use dashes for emphasis
- Use calls to action

---

## Category Discipline Rule

AlphaPing is NOT:
- A protocol
- An infrastructure provider
- A yield aggregator
- A marketing platform

AlphaPing IS:
- An operator layer
- A vault deployer and manager
- A curator with distribution reach

---

## Swap Test (Hard Fail Rule)

If replacing “AlphaPing” with:
- Any other DeFi operator
- Any risk manager
- Any vault curator

…does NOT materially break the meaning, the content FAILS and must be rewritten.

---

## Default Writing Bias

- Factual > aspirational
- Operational > narrative
- Specific > generic
- Constraint > upside

==================================================
FILE: codex/NARRATIVE_POSITIONING.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Narrative & Positioning Codex

## Core Positioning

AlphaPing operates the vault layer for institutional funds.

We do not provide infrastructure.
We do not sell software.
We do not compete with funds.

We deploy, operate, and distribute vaults on behalf of funds that do not want to build an operator organization themselves.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Launching a vault is not the hard part.
Operating a vault over time is.

Real vault operations require:
- Continuous risk management
- Collateral selection and maintenance
- Liquidation readiness and counterparties
- Protocol relationships
- Market monitoring through stress
- Distribution and allocator access

Most funds underestimate this operational surface area.

---

## AlphaPing’s Role

AlphaPing acts as the **operator of record**.

For partner funds, this means:
- AlphaPing deploys and manages the vault
- AlphaPing defines and enforces the mandate
- AlphaPing handles collateral frameworks and relationships
- AlphaPing manages liquidation paths and execution readiness
- AlphaPing connects the vault to allocator and aggregator distribution

The partner fund does not need to build these capabilities internally.

---

## Distribution Advantage

Vaults operated by AlphaPing are not isolated.

AlphaPing brings:
- Existing allocator relationships
- Visibility across yield aggregation platforms
- External capital beyond the partner’s own LP base

This creates a secondary income stream for the partner fund via management fees on externally sourced capital.

---

## Economic Structure (Canonical)

- AlphaPing earns a performance fee on realized yield
- The partner fund may earn a management fee (e.g. 0.5% p.a.)
- Fees are transparent and defined upfront
- Incentives are aligned: performance for AlphaPing, scale for the partner

---

## What Makes This Defensible

AlphaPing’s edge compounds over time:
- Operational track record
- Stress-tested vault history
- Collateral and protocol relationships
- Allocator trust
- Distribution access

This cannot be replicated quickly by new entrants.

---

## Category Definition

AlphaPing defines a distinct category:

**Operator-Grade Vault Management with Embedded Distribution**

This is not infrastructure.
This is not advisory.
This is execution.

==================================================
FILE: codex/ENFORCEMENT_RULES.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Codex Enforcement Rules

## Authority
All documents in `/codex` are authoritative.

They override:
- Personal writing style
- Marketing preferences
- Platform norms
- Engagement tactics

If there is a conflict, the codex wins.

---

## Who May Edit Codex Files

- Only AlphaPing principals
- No external contributors
- No delegated authority

Marketing collaborators may NOT edit files in `/codex`.

---

## What Happens on Violation

Content is rejected if it:
- Sounds promotional
- Uses generic DeFi language
- Could be published under a competitor’s name
- Introduces urgency, hype, or persuasion
- Deviates from operator-first framing

Rejected content is rewritten or discarded.
No exceptions.

---

## Interpretation Rule

If a sentence requires explanation, it is wrong.

If intent is ambiguous, the default action is:
DO NOT PUBLISH.

---

## Final Test (Hard Gate)

Before publication, ask:

1. Does this sound like an operator speaking to peers?
2. Is this specific to AlphaPing’s role?
3. Would this still work if markets were stressed?

If any answer is NO, the content fails.

==================================================
FILE: codex/ANATOMY_GATE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Content Anatomy Gate (Mandatory)

This document is a hard gate for all AlphaPing external content.

No content may be drafted, reviewed, or published unless it explicitly follows ONE approved skeleton.

If this gate is violated, the content is rejected without revision.

---

## Approved Skeletons (Choose Exactly One)

Every draft MUST declare which skeleton it uses.

Approved skeletons are:

- SKELETON_LINKEDIN_OPERATOR_INSIGHT.md
- SKELETON_LINKEDIN_MARKET_STRUCTURE.md
- SKELETON_X_ORIGINAL_POST.md
- SKELETON_X_REPLY.md
- SKELETON_SUBSTACK_MEMO.md

No other structures are allowed.

---

## Declaration Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

Every draft MUST start with this header:

Skeleton Used:
<exact filename>

If this header is missing, the draft FAILS automatically.

---

## Structural Rules

- You may ONLY fill the sections defined in the chosen skeleton
- You may NOT add sections
- You may NOT rename sections
- You may NOT reorder sections
- You may NOT merge sections
- You may NOT add conclusions, summaries, or CTAs

If additional thoughts exist, they are discarded.

---

## Cross-Skeleton Mixing (Hard NO)

Mixing multiple skeletons in a single draft is forbidden.

Example of failure:
- LinkedIn-style framing inside a Substack memo
- Thread-style pacing inside LinkedIn
- Narrative arcs inside X replies

If mixed, the draft FAILS.

---

## Relationship to Other Codex Files

This gate overrides:
- Personal writing preference
- Marketing judgment
- AI suggestions
- Platform “best practices”

If there is a conflict:
ANATOMY_GATE.md wins.

---

## Enforcement

- Marketing may not override this gate
- ChatGPT output is not exempt
- “It reads better this way” is not a justification

When in doubt:
REJECT.

---

## Final Rule

Structure comes before words.
Discipline comes before creativity.

==================================================
FILE: codex/CONTENT_APPROVAL_CHECKLIST.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Content Approval Checklist (Hard Gate)

This checklist MUST be passed before any content is published.

If any item fails, the content is rejected.
No partial passes. No exceptions.

---

## 1. Category & Role Check

- ☐ Does this clearly come from an operator perspective?
- ☐ Is AlphaPing acting as operator-of-record, not commentator?
- ☐ Does this avoid protocol, infrastructure, or advisory framing?

If unclear → FAIL.

---

## 2. Swap Test (Mandatory)

- ☐ Replace “AlphaPing” with another DeFi operator.

Does the content still fully work?

- ☐ NO → PASS
- ☐ YES → FAIL

If YES, rewrite or discard.

---

## 3. Substance Test

- ☐ Does this add structural insight?
- ☐ Does it reflect real operational experience?
- ☐ Does it hold up during market stress?

If it is opinion-only → FAIL.

---

## 4. Language & Tone Check

- ☐ No hype
- ☐ No persuasion
- ☐ No optimism signaling
- ☐ No future promises
- ☐ No calls to action
- ☐ No buzzwords

Any violation → FAIL.

---

## 5. Motivation Check

Why does this exist?

- ☐ To explain structure
- ☐ To document reality
- ☐ To clarify risk or operations

If the answer is “visibility”, “engagement”, or “growth” → FAIL.

---

## 6. Platform Discipline

- ☐ LinkedIn: reads like IC commentary
- ☐ X: concise operator observation
- ☐ Substack: memo-level depth

Wrong format → FAIL.

---

## 7. Final Stress Test

Ask:

- ☐ Would this still be acceptable in a down-only market?
- ☐ Would this embarrass us if quoted out of context?
- ☐ Would we stand by this 12 months from now?

Any doubt → DO NOT PUBLISH.

---

## Default Action

When unsure:
REJECT.

==================================================
FILE: codex/COMMON_FAILURE_EXAMPLES.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Common Failure Examples (Read Carefully)

This document shows examples of content that FAILS.

These examples are intentionally explicit.
If your draft resembles any of these patterns, it will be rejected.

---

## Failure Type 1 — Generic DeFi Language

❌ FAIL:
“AlphaPing delivers best-in-class DeFi strategies for institutional investors.”

Why this fails:
- Could describe dozens of firms
- Uses marketing adjectives
- No operator specificity

---

## Failure Type 2 — Competitor Swap Passes

❌ FAIL:
“We provide institutional-grade vaults with robust risk management.”

Why this fails:
- Gauntlet, Steakhouse, Re7, or others could publish this unchanged
- No unique role definition
- Swap Test fails

---

## Failure Type 3 — Promotional Framing

❌ FAIL:
“We’re excited to announce the launch of our new vault.”

Why this fails:
- Announcement language
- Emotional framing
- No operational insight

Correct behavior:
If there is nothing structural to say, say nothing.

---

## Failure Type 4 — Future-Promise Language

❌ FAIL:
“This positions AlphaPing to capture the next wave of institutional DeFi adoption.”

Why this fails:
- Speculative
- Forward-looking
- Narrative, not operations

AlphaPing describes what IS, not what might happen.

---

## Failure Type 5 — Engagement Optimization

❌ FAIL:
“What do you think about this trend?”

Why this fails:
- Engagement farming
- Outsourcing thinking to the audience
- Violates institutional posture

AlphaPing does not ask the crowd for validation.

---

## Failure Type 6 — Over-Explaining AlphaPing

❌ FAIL:
“At AlphaPing, we believe transparency and trust are critical…”

Why this fails:
- Values statements without evidence
- Sounds defensive
- Reads like marketing copy

Trust is demonstrated through structure, not stated.

---

## Failure Type 7 — Reply Without Substance

❌ FAIL (Reply):
“Totally agree — great point.”

Why this fails:
- Adds no information
- Wastes presence
- Lowers perceived signal

If you cannot add structure or experience, do not reply.

---

## Failure Type 8 — Borrowed Vocabulary

❌ FAIL:
“Unlocking yield opportunities through innovative vault design.”

Why this fails:
- Borrowed crypto vocabulary
- Buzzwords
- Zero operational content

---

## Failure Type 9 — Call To Action

❌ FAIL:
“Learn more about AlphaPing.”

Why this fails:
- Promotional
- Unnecessary
- Violates tone codex

AlphaPing never asks to be explored.

---

## Final Rule

If a draft makes AlphaPing sound:
- Louder
- Faster
- More opinionated
- More optimistic
- More persuasive

…it is wrong.

Default action: REJECT.

==================================================
FILE: codex/DRAFT_REJECTION_TEMPLATE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Draft Rejection Notice

This draft is rejected.

Rejection is based on structure and discipline, not effort.

---

## Reason for Rejection (Primary)

☐ Anatomy Gate violation  
☐ Wrong skeleton selected  
☐ Multiple skeletons mixed  
☐ Missing skeleton declaration  
☐ Extra sections added  
☐ Sections reordered or merged  

If Anatomy Gate fails, content is rejected automatically.

---

## Reason for Rejection (Secondary)

☐ Swap Test failed (competitor replacement still works)  
☐ Generic DeFi language  
☐ Promotional framing  
☐ Opinion without structural insight  
☐ Future-oriented or speculative language  
☐ Engagement-seeking language  
☐ Over-explaining AlphaPing  
☐ Reply without substance  

Any single item above is sufficient for rejection.

---

## What Is NOT Required

- No rewrite is required
- No justification is required
- No discussion is required

If a rewrite is explicitly requested, it will be scoped and instructed.

---

## Next Action

- Discard this draft
- Re-read the relevant skeleton
- Re-submit only if structure is followed exactly

---

## Reminder

Silence is preferable to misalignment.

==================================================
FILE: codex/CRISIS_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Crisis Communication Protocol

This protocol governs all external communication during stress events.

A crisis is defined as:
- Loss or risk of loss of user funds
- Liquidity impairment
- Protocol failure or exploit
- Forced liquidation events
- Operational degradation
- Market stress requiring operator intervention

If unsure whether this applies, assume it DOES.

---

## Core Principle

AlphaPing communicates to reduce uncertainty, not to manage sentiment.

Silence is acceptable.
Speculation is not.

---

## Communication Objectives (In Order)

1. Preserve factual accuracy
2. Reduce ambiguity
3. Maintain credibility
4. Avoid escalation

Reputation follows accuracy, not reassurance.

---

## What We Communicate

ONLY communicate:
- Verified facts
- Known scope of impact
- What is functioning normally
- What actions are being taken
- What is explicitly NOT yet known

If something is unknown, say it is unknown.

---

## What We NEVER Communicate

- Blame
- Optimism
- Predictions
- Timelines unless confirmed
- Emotional reassurance
- Comparisons to other failures
- Defensive language

---

## Approved Message Structure

All crisis communication MUST follow this structure:

1. Situation
   - What happened (facts only)

2. Impact
   - What is affected
   - What is NOT affected

3. Status
   - What is operating as designed
   - What actions are underway

4. Unknowns
   - Explicitly state what is still being assessed

5. Next Update
   - When the next update will occur (if known)

No additional sections are allowed.

---

## Tone Requirements

- Calm
- Neutral
- Short sentences
- No adjectives
- No reassurance language

Examples of forbidden words:
“safe”, “secure”, “funds are fine”, “under control”, “as expected”

Facts replace adjectives.

---

## Platform Usage During Crisis

### X (Twitter)
- Used only for short factual updates
- No threads unless required for clarity
- No replies to speculation

### LinkedIn
- Used only if institutional clarification is required
- Single post max per update

### Substack
- Used only for post-mortem after resolution
- Never during active incident

---

## Reply Discipline

During a crisis:
- Do not reply to questions individually
- Do not engage in debate
- Do not correct rumors unless material

All communication is centralized and deliberate.

---

## Internal Approval Gate

Before publishing any crisis communication:
- Facts verified by operator
- Language checked against codex
- Approval by AlphaPing principal

If verification is incomplete:
DO NOT PUBLISH.

---

## Resolution Communication

After resolution:
- One final factual update
- One post-mortem (Substack)
- No victory language
- No “lessons learned” posturing

Return to normal silence.

---

## Final Rule

During crisis:
Doing less is almost always better than doing more.

==================================================
FILE: codex/OFFICIAL_ACCOUNT_REPLY_RULES.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — Official Account Reply Rules (@0xAlphaPing)

The @0xAlphaPing account represents operator presence, not brand voice.

Replies are allowed ONLY when they:
- Are purely operational
- Add structural insight
- Contain no self-reference
- Avoid promotion, opinion, or speculation
- Would stand if posted anonymously

The account does not debate, predict, persuade, or reassure.

---

## Style Rules

- One insight per reply
- One or two sentences max
- No “we”, no “our”, no AlphaPing mentions

---

## Cadence

- X (Twitter): max 2–3 replies per week
- LinkedIn: no replies
- Substack: no comments

---

## Default Rule

If unsure:
DO NOT REPLY.

==================================================
FILE: codex/CHATGPT_GITHUB_USAGE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — ChatGPT & GitHub Usage Guide (Mandatory)

This document defines the ONLY approved way to use ChatGPT for AlphaPing content.

If this process is not followed exactly, the draft is rejected automatically.

---

## Core Principle

ChatGPT does NOT know AlphaPing by default.

ChatGPT must be explicitly given:
- The AlphaPing codex
- The correct content skeleton
- The current theme

ChatGPT must NEVER infer, summarize, or “remember” rules.

---

## Approved Connection Methods

### Method A — Copy-Paste Codex Pack (REQUIRED)

This is the default and required method.

There is NO automatic GitHub integration assumed.

---

### Method B — GitHub Connector (Optional, Not Required)

If ChatGPT has a GitHub connector enabled:
- It MAY be used to READ files
- It does NOT replace the copy-paste method
- Files must still be explicitly referenced

If you are unsure whether the connector is working:
DO NOT USE IT.

---

## Mandatory Files to Load (Every New Chat)

For EVERY AlphaPing drafting session, you MUST provide ChatGPT with:

1. `codex/VOICE_TONE_LANGUAGE.md`
2. `codex/NARRATIVE_POSITIONING.md`
3. `codex/ANATOMY_GATE.md`
4. ONE chosen skeleton file:
   - `codex/SKELETON_LINKEDIN_OPERATOR_INSIGHT.md`
   - `codex/SKELETON_LINKEDIN_MARKET_STRUCTURE.md`
   - `codex/SKELETON_X_ORIGINAL_POST.md`
   - `codex/SKELETON_X_REPLY.md`
   - `codex/SKELETON_SUBSTACK_MEMO.md`
5. The relevant theme from:
   - `content-plan/CONTENT_CALENDAR_30D.md`

If any item is missing, STOP.

---

## Exact ChatGPT Initialization Prompt (Paste Verbatim)

This prompt MUST be pasted at the top of every new ChatGPT conversation:

You are drafting AlphaPing content.

You must strictly follow the AlphaPing codex files provided below.
You may not invent structure, tone, facts, or positioning.

You must follow the AlphaPing Content Anatomy Gate.
You may only use ONE skeleton and must not add sections.

If anything is unclear or missing, STOP and ask instead of guessing.

First, confirm which skeleton will be used and list its required sections.
Then produce a draft that fills ONLY those sections.

The draft MUST begin with:
Skeleton Used: 

If ChatGPT does not restate the skeleton and sections first, STOP.

---

## Drafting Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. Open GitHub repository
2. Open required codex files
3. Copy contents
4. Open a NEW ChatGPT chat
5. Paste:
   - Initialization prompt
   - Codex files
   - Chosen skeleton
   - Weekly theme
6. Ask ChatGPT to draft
7. Verify:
   - Skeleton declaration present
   - No extra sections
8. Save draft to `/drafts`

Skipping any step = rejection.

---

## What ChatGPT Is NOT Allowed To Do

ChatGPT must NOT:
- Invent facts
- Invent AlphaPing positioning
- Optimize for engagement
- Add conclusions or CTAs
- Add sections beyond the skeleton
- Summarize the codex instead of following it

“ChatGPT suggested it” is not a valid justification.

---

## Enforcement

- Any draft missing `Skeleton Used:` fails automatically
- Any draft that adds sections fails automatically
- Any draft that sounds generic fails the Swap Test

Use:
`codex/DRAFT_REJECTION_TEMPLATE.md`

No discussion required.

---

## Final Rule

ChatGPT is a drafting tool.

The codex is the authority.

Structure comes before words.

==================================================
FILE: codex/CHAT_INITIALIZATION_PROMPT.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — ChatGPT Initialization Prompt (Mandatory)

This prompt MUST be pasted verbatim at the start of every new ChatGPT conversation
used for AlphaPing-related work.

If this prompt is not used, the output is invalid.

---

## CHAT INITIALIZATION PROMPT (COPY–PASTE BELOW)

You are working on AlphaPing.

You must NOT assume any context.
You must explicitly read and follow AlphaPing’s authoritative files.

---

## Repository to Use (MANDATORY)

You MUST read files from the following GitHub repository only:

---

## Access & Fallback Rule (MANDATORY)

First, attempt to open and read the required files directly from the repository using your GitHub connector.

If you cannot directly access and open the repository files:
- You MUST STOP and request that the required files be pasted into the chat (full text or relevant excerpts).
- You MUST NOT draft, suggest, or infer anything until the required files are provided.

This is not optional.

---

## STEP 1 — Read Authoritative Files (MANDATORY)

---

## STEP 2 — Confirm File Reads (MANDATORY)

Before proceeding, explicitly confirm that you have read the files by listing:

- Filename
- One-line description of what each file governs

If ANY file cannot be read:
- If GitHub access failed: request the missing file(s) to be pasted.
- If pasted files are not provided: STOP.

Do NOT infer, summarize from memory, or guess.

---

## STEP 3 — Declare Skeleton (MANDATORY)

Before drafting anything, declare:

Skeleton Used: <exact filename>

If no skeleton is declared, STOP.

---

## STEP 4 — Drafting Rules (MANDATORY)

When drafting:

- Follow ONLY the declared skeleton
- Do NOT add sections
- Do NOT reorder sections
- Do NOT add conclusions, summaries, or CTAs
- Do NOT introduce facts not present in provided material
- Do NOT optimize for engagement

If something is unclear or missing, STOP and ask instead of guessing.

---

## STEP 5 — Output & Stop Rule (MANDATORY)

When drafting is complete:

- Produce ONE draft only
- Do NOT suggest edits, variants, or next steps
- Do NOT propose publishing or replies
- Do NOT add commentary outside the draft

Assume:

- Draft will be saved to /drafts
- Approval is binary and handled separately
- You are not the decision-maker

After producing the draft, STOP.

---

## FAILURE MODE (IMPORTANT)

If you cannot confidently comply with all steps above, you MUST respond with the following and nothing else:

“I cannot proceed because the required AlphaPing context is missing.”

This is the correct behavior.

---

## END OF PROMPT

==================================================
FILE: codex/CHAT_PREFLIGHT_FAIL_RESPONSE.md
==================================================

# AlphaPing — ChatGPT Preflight FAIL Response

This response is used when ChatGPT cannot safely proceed
due to missing or unread AlphaPing context.

It must be returned verbatim.

---

## PRE-FLIGHT FAIL RESPONSE (VERBATIM)

I cannot proceed safely.

I have not been able to confirm that I have read all required AlphaPing authoritative files.

To continue, I must explicitly read and confirm the following:
- AlphaPing codex files
- The applicable content skeleton
- The current content plan

Until this is completed, I will not draft, suggest, or infer content.

Please provide access or explicitly instruct me to read the required files.

---

## Enforcement Rule

If ChatGPT does NOT return this response when required context is missing,
the output is invalid and must be rejected.

---

## Reminder

Failing early is correct behavior.
Guessing is not.

# AlphaPing — Marketing Operating Instructions

## Purpose
This document defines how marketing contributors work with AlphaPing content.

Marketing supports execution.
Marketing does not define voice, narrative, or positioning.

---

## What Marketing IS Responsible For

- Turning approved themes into drafts
- Formatting content per platform norms
- Grammar and clarity improvements
- Scheduling approved content
- Managing drafts and archive hygiene

---

## What Marketing Is NOT Responsible For

- Defining topics
- Inventing narratives
- Increasing posting frequency
- Adjusting tone or language
- Rewriting content to improve “engagement”
- Speaking on behalf of AlphaPing

---

## Workflow (Mandatory)

1. AlphaPing defines themes (via content plan)
2. Marketing creates drafts in `/drafts`
3. AlphaPing reviews and edits
4. Approved content is scheduled
5. Published content is archived in `/archive`

No step may be skipped.

---

## Drafting Rules

- Drafts must reference the content plan theme
- Drafts must comply with all codex rules
- Drafts may be rejected without revision

Rejection is normal.
Iteration is expected.
Approval is explicit.

---

## Replies & Engagement

- Marketing does NOT reply on behalf of AlphaPing
- Replies are written only by AlphaPing principals
- Marketing may flag posts worth replying to

---

## Escalation Rule

If unsure:
DO NOTHING and ask.

Silence is preferable to misalignment.

==================================================

# AlphaPing — Marketing Runbook: What To Do Next (Mandatory)

This document defines what happens AFTER ChatGPT is initialized successfully.

Marketing is execution.
AlphaPing principals are approval and replies.

If this runbook is not followed, output is invalid.

---

## Your Operating Mode

You are an extension of AlphaPing operations.

Your job is to:
- Turn approved themes into drafts
- Keep structure and tone compliant
- Make review and publishing frictionless

Your job is NOT to:
- Invent messaging
- Increase frequency
- Add promotion
- Reply on behalf of AlphaPing

---

## Daily/Weekly Workflow (Exact)

### Step 1 — Choose the task
Only work on ONE of:
- This week’s primary content draft
- A scheduled share (e.g., Substack link share on LinkedIn)
- A draft revision explicitly requested by AlphaPing
- A list of “posts worth replying to” (no replies written)

If none apply: stop.

---

### Step 2 — Initialize ChatGPT (Mandatory)
Use:
- codex/CHAT_INITIALIZATION_PROMPT.md

If ChatGPT cannot confirm file reads:
Stop and use:
- codex/CHAT_PREFLIGHT_FAIL_RESPONSE.md

No exceptions.

---

### Step 3 — Select ONE skeleton
Pick the correct skeleton for the task.

Draft MUST begin with:
Skeleton Used: <exact filename>

If missing, the draft is rejected automatically.

---

### Step 4 — Draft within the skeleton ONLY
- Fill only the sections
- Do not add sections
- Do not reorder sections
- No conclusions, summaries, or CTAs
- No facts unless explicitly provided in the prompt or repo files

If something is missing or unclear:
Stop and ask.

---

### Step 5 — Save draft to GitHub (Mandatory)
All drafts go into:

/drafts

Filename format (exact):
YYYY-MM-DD__PLATFORM__TOPIC_SLUG.md

Examples:
2026-02-03__LINKEDIN__operate-vs-deploy.md
2026-02-10__X__collateral-is-constraint.md
2026-02-18__SUBSTACK__institutional-underestimates.md

---

### Step 6 — Request approval (Binary)
Approval is binary: approved or rejected.

Use only:
- codex/DRAFT_GREENLIGHT_TEMPLATE.md
- codex/DRAFT_REJECTION_TEMPLATE.md

No discussion.
No negotiation.

---

### Step 7 — Publish and archive
After approval:

1) Publish exactly as approved
2) Move the final published version into:

/archive

Filename format (exact):
YYYY-MM-DD__PLATFORM__PUBLISHED__TOPIC_SLUG.md

Do not overwrite drafts.
Do not delete history.

---

## Reply Handling (Strict)

Marketing does NOT reply from any account.

Marketing MAY:
- Provide a short list of “posts worth replying to”
- Include link + one-line reason
- No suggested reply text unless explicitly requested

Founder replies:
- Gabe account allowed
Official replies:
- @0xAlphaPing allowed on X only (per codex rules)

---

## Updating This System (Governance)

### What marketing may update
- Drafts in /drafts
- Content planning notes in /content-plan (only if explicitly instructed)

### What marketing may NOT update
- Anything under /codex
- Any enforcement, tone, narrative, skeleton, or gate documents

If a codex change is desired:
Propose it in a GitHub Issue or a comment.
Do not edit codex files.

---

## Safety Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- If unsure: do nothing and ask
- Silence is preferable to misalignment
- “ChatGPT suggested it” is not a justification
- If a claim cannot be supported by provided material, it must be removed
- No crisis commentary outside codex/CRISIS_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL.md

---

## Definition of Done (Each Draft)

A draft is done only if:
- Skeleton Used header is present
- Structure matches the chosen skeleton exactly
- Tone passes VOICE_TONE_LANGUAGE
- Swap Test would fail (i.e., competitor replacement breaks meaning)
- No extra claims or invented facts
- Saved in /drafts with correct filename
